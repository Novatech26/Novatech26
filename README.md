        <h2>Read About Me</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Chima-Ibeh Izunna Ezenwa. I have a background in Biochemistry and I'm currently pursuing a master's degree in Pharmacology and Therapeutics at the University of Ibadan. While my academic journey has been rooted in the life sciences, I've made the decision to transition fully into software engineering—a field where I can apply my problem-solving mindset and passion for building practical solutions.
          I'm currently training through the ALX software engineering program, where I'm developing core skills in Python, Git, JavaScript, and API integration. What started as an interest has grown into a clear career path. I'm excited about the possibilities technology offers—not just in healthcare, but across industries—and I'm focused on becoming a versatile, impact-driven software engineer.
          My scientific background has taught me how to think critically, learn continuously, and work through complex systems—qualities that now shape how I approach coding and software design. I'm committed to building solutions that are not only functional but meaningful, and I look forward to contributing to innovative teams and projects in tech.
